### Workshop Agenda

#### Session 1: Identity & Access Management (9:15 – 9:45 AM)
**Speakers:** Huynh Hoang Long, Dinh Le Hoang Anh

##### IAM Fundamentals
- **What is IAM?**: Understanding Identity and Access Management
- **What IAM Manages**:
  - Users: Individual accounts for people and applications
  - Groups: Collections of users with shared permissions
  - Roles: Temporary credentials for services and users
  - Policies: Documents that define permissions
- **What IAM Ensures**:
  - Authentication: Verifying identity
  - Authorization: Controlling access to resources
  - Auditability: Tracking who did what and when

##### IAM Best Practices

**Principle of Least Privilege**
- Granting only the minimum permissions necessary
- Starting with no permissions and adding only what's needed
- Regular review and removal of unnecessary permissions
- Using IAM Access Analyzer to identify over-permissive policies

**Root Account Security**
- **Never use root access keys**: Root credentials provide unlimited access
- **Delete root access keys**: Removing any existing root access keys
- **Enable MFA for root**: Multi-factor authentication as an additional security layer
- **Use root only for account management**: Limiting root usage to essential tasks

**Policy Management**
- **Use managed policies**: Leveraging AWS-managed policies when possible
- **Create custom policies**: When AWS-managed policies don't fit
- **Avoid wildcards ("*")**: Being specific about allowed actions and resources
- **Policy versioning**: Managing policy changes over time
- **Policy testing**: Using IAM policy simulator

**Role-Based Access**
- **Use roles instead of users for applications**: Roles provide temporary credentials
- **Assume roles**: Using role assumption for cross-account and service access
- **Role chaining**: Understanding role assumption limits
- **Session duration**: Setting appropriate session timeouts

**AWS Login Best Practices**
- **Use AWS SSO or IAM Identity Center**: Centralized identity management
- **Avoid long-lived access keys**: Preferring temporary credentials
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Changing access keys periodically
- **Use AWS CLI with profiles**: Managing multiple credentials securely

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **MFA for all users**: Requiring MFA for human users
- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Using authenticator apps
- **FIDO2**: Hardware security keys for stronger authentication
- **MFA for root**: Critical for root account protection
- **MFA for privileged operations**: Requiring MFA for sensitive actions

**Credential Rotation**
- **Regular rotation**: Changing credentials on a schedule
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Automated rotation for database credentials, API keys, etc.
- **Rotation strategies**: Different approaches for different credential types
- **Monitoring rotation**: Ensuring rotation occurs successfully

##### Single Sign-On (SSO) / IAM Identity Center

**SSO Concepts**
- **Single sign-on**: Logging in once to access multiple services
- **Centralized identity management**: One place to manage all identities
- **Multi-account integration**: Using SSO across AWS Organizations
- **Multiple roles**: Users can have different roles for different accounts

**IAM Identity Center Features**
- **User and group management**: Centralized user administration
- **Application assignments**: Assigning access to AWS and third-party applications
- **Permission sets**: Reusable collections of permissions
- **Session management**: Controlling session duration and policies

**AWS Organizations Integration**
- **Organization-wide SSO**: SSO works across all accounts in an organization
- **Account management**: Simplifying access to multiple accounts
- **Centralized governance**: Managing access from one place

##### Service Control Policies (SCPs)

**SCP Overview**
- **Maximum permissions**: Setting the maximum permissions for accounts in an organization
- **Not granting permissions**: SCPs filter permissions but don't grant them
- **Deny by default**: Understanding how SCPs work with allow/deny logic
- **Organization-level control**: Applying policies at the organization level

**SCP Use Cases**
- **Preventing certain actions**: Blocking risky operations across all accounts
- **Enforcing compliance**: Ensuring all accounts meet compliance requirements
- **Cost control**: Preventing expensive operations
- **Security guardrails**: Enforcing security policies organization-wide

##### Permission Boundaries

**Permission Boundary Concepts**
- **Maximum permissions for policies**: Setting limits on what policies can grant
- **Applied to roles or users**: Using permission boundaries to constrain access
- **Not granting permissions**: Like SCPs, they filter rather than grant
- **Fine-grained control**: More granular than SCPs

**Use Cases**
- **Delegating policy creation**: Allowing teams to create policies within limits
- **Preventing privilege escalation**: Ensuring users can't grant themselves more access
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for access control

##### Relationship Between IAM, SCPs, and Permission Boundaries
- **IAM Policies**: Grant permissions to users, groups, and roles
- **Permission Boundaries**: Limit what IAM policies can grant
- **SCPs**: Limit what's possible at the organization level
- **Evaluation order**: Understanding how these work together
- **Effective permissions**: Calculating what a user can actually do

##### Credentials Spectrum

**Long-term Credentials**
- **IAM user access keys**: Permanent credentials with no expiration
- **Risks**: If compromised, remain valid until manually rotated
- **Use cases**: Limited scenarios where long-term credentials are necessary
- **Best practice**: Avoid when possible

**Short-term Credentials**
- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**: Temporary credentials
- **Benefits**: Automatic expiration, reduced risk if compromised
- **Session tokens**: Time-limited access
- **Best practice**: Use short-term credentials whenever possible
